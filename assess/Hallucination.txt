Guidelines:
1. The OUTPUT must not introduce new information beyond what's provided in the CONTEXT.
2. The OUTPUT must not contradict any information given in the CONTEXT.
3. Ignore the INPUT when evaluating faithfulness; it's provided for context only.
4. Consider partial hallucinations where some information is correct but other parts are not.
5. Pay close attention to the subject of statements. Ensure that attributes, actions, or dates are correctly associated with the right entities (e.g., a person vs. a TV show they star in).
6. Be vigilant for subtle misattributions or conflations of information, even if the date or other details are correct.
7. Check that the OUTPUT doesn't oversimplify or generalize information in a way that changes its meaning or accuracy.

Verdict options:
- "{FACTUAL_VERDICT}": The OUTPUT is entirely faithful to the CONTEXT.
- "{HALLUCINATION_VERDICT}": The OUTPUT contains hallucinations or unfaithful information.
